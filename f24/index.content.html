	<h3>About</h3>
	This is an introductory course in computer networks that is suitable for undergraduate and beginning graduate students. The course will cover the foundational ideas, architecture, protocols and software that constitute the internet. It includes a hands-on component to familiarize students with how the internet works today. We expect students to be familiar with programming, algorithms, and basic probability. The course has three goals:

	<ol>
	  <li>How does the internet work today?</li>
	  <li>Why has it been designed this way?</li>
	  <li>How can we use, program and write applications for the internet?</li>
	</ol>

	We will use the <a href="https://book.systemsapproach.org/">Computer Systems: Systems Approach</a> textbook by Larry Peterson and Bruce Davie
