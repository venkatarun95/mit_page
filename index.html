<p>My group works on the fundamentals of computer networking by developing theoretical ideas to gain insights that would have been difficult to discover otherwise. The goal is to build networked systems that can support the next generation of applications. My past work has spanned internet congestion control, video streaming, privacy-preserving computation, wireless networks, and mobile systems.</p>

      <p class="card-text"><p>We are developing a set of methods to design networked systems that perform reliably. Today, we build systems with hundreds of heuristic control algorithms whose emergent behaviors we do not fully understand. These algorithms provision compute resources, choose network routes, allocate bandwidth and storage resources, schedule tasks etc. These tasks are central to the performance and reliability of networked systems, making it crucial for the algorithms to make correct decisions. Designing such algorithms is hard because they operate in the face of incomplete information, uncertainty about the future and constraints on decision-making latency. Thus, a lot of effort goes into their design, based largely on empirical trial-and-error. Today, we lack principled ways to reason about their performance. In this project, we are developing a set of techniques to address this gap, often using program verification and synthesis techniques to augment human intelligence.</p><p>There is now a vibrant community of researchers working on the topic, including people from CMU, U.

      <h5>"Solving" Congestion Control</h5>

    <div class="card-body" style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;">
      <p class="card-text"><p>We have embarked on a (potentially foolish) journey to "solve" end-to-end congestion control for the internet. To this end, we first came up with a mathematical definition of what it means to solve it [<abbr title="Toward formally verifying congestion control behavior. Venkat Arun, Mina T. Arashloo, Ahmed Saeed, Mohammad Alizadeh, and Hari Balakrishnan. In ACM SIGCOMM 2021">SIGCOMM21</abbr>]. Existing definitions assume far too much about how the network behaves. Thus, we came up with a method to specify network models that make minimal assumptions and are nevertheless sufficient for congestion control algorithms (CCAs) to work (we later realized this technique was general, which lead to our work on performance verification).</p> <p> The next challenge is to find a CCA that achieves a set of performance properties under this network model. This is ongoing work, where we heavily use automated reasoning to discover algorithms and prove impossibility results [<abbr title="Starvation in end-to-end congestion control.

    <div class="card-body" style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;">
      <p class="card-text"><p>Fundamental diffraction limits tell us that the more antennas a radio device has, the more precisely it can control the signals. This project explores the new applications enabled by having thousands of radio-frequency antennas, made inexpensive through meta-surfaces. As a first step toward this, we built a system with 3200 antennas that can increase the signal strength between two radio endpoints by about 10&times; [<abbr title="RFocus: Beamforming Using Thousands of Passive Antennas. Venkat Arun and Hari Balakrishnan. In USENIX NSDI 2020">NSDI20</abbr>]. It works by automatically reconfiguring itself to passively reflect signals from the transmitter to the receiver. The very large number of antennas allows it to create extremely focussed beams that can increase point-to-point communication bandwidth and reduce interference between multiple pairs of communicating endpoints.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the largest number of antennas ever used for a single communication link.</p></p>

	       <!--<p> In the past, I have worked on internet congestion control, video streaming, privacy-preserving computation, wireless networks, and mobile systems. Across these areas, a unifying theme of my work is to bridge between heuristics that systems use in practice and proofs of how well they work. I have shown that current heuristics fail to provide performance guarantees, and I have used proofs to design more robust systems. My principal contribution is a set of tools and techniques to prove performance properties of real-world heuristics running in real-world conditions.</p>-->
	       <p>These methods have sparked interest among researchers, with groups from CMU, UT Austin, Georgia Tech, MIT, Microsoft Research, and Waterloo all working on related projects. I am collaborating with several of them. It has also impacted industrial practice. For instance, we proposed a modification to BBR [<abbr title="Toward formally verifying congestion control behavior. Venkat Arun, Mina T. Arashloo, Ahmed Saeed, Mohammad Alizadeh, Hari Balakrishnan. In ACM SIGCOMM 2021.">CCAC</abbr>], a widely deployed CCA developed by Google. Facebook uses this modification for a vast majority of their user-facing traffic. In addition, for live video uploads, Facebook uses my algorithm, <abbr title="Copa: practical delay-based congestion control for the internet. Venkat Arun, Hari Balakrishnan. In NSDI 2018.">Copa</abbr>.</p>
	       <p>In addition to Performance Verification, I am broadly interested in networked systems. In the past, I have worked on  internet congestion control, video streaming, privacy-preserving computation, wireless networks, and mobile systems. For instance, one line of my work examines the new applications enabled by having thousands of radio-frequency antennas, made inexpensive through meta-surfaces. <abbr title="RFocus: Beamforming with thousands of inexpensive antennas. Venkat Arun, Hari Balakrishnan. In NSDI 2020">RFocus</abbr> is such a surface that improves the signal strength between a pair of endpoints by 10&times;. To our knowledge, it is the largest published number of antennas ever used for a single communication link.</p>
