                        <p>This paper introduces Copa, an end-to-end congestion control algorithm that uses three ideas. First, it shows that a <em>target rate</em> equal to <em>1/(&delta; d<sub>q</sub>)</em>, where <em>d<sub>q</sub></em> is the (measured) queueing delay, optimizes a natural function of throughput and delay under a Markovian packet arrival model. Second, it adjusts its congestion window in the direction of this target rate, converging quickly to the correct fair rates even in the face of significant flow churn. These two ideas enable a group of Copa flows to maintain high utilization with low queuing delay. However, when the bottleneck is shared with loss-based congestion-controlled flows that fill up buffers, Copa, like other delay-sensitive schemes, achieves low throughput. To combat this problem, Copa uses a third idea: detect the presence of buffer-fillers by observing the delay evolution, and respond with additive-increase/multiplicative decrease on the &delta; parameter. Experimental results show that Copa outperforms Cubic (similar throughput, much lower delay, fairer with diverse RTTs), BBR and PCC (significantly fairer, lower delay), and co-exists well with Cubic unlike BBR and PCC. Copa is also robust to non-congestive loss and large bottleneck buffers, and outperforms other schemes on long-RTT paths.</p>

                        <p>To reduce transmit power, increase throughput, and improve range, radio systems benefit from the ability to direct more of the transmitted power toward the intended receiver. Many modern systems beamform with antenna arrays for this purpose. However, a radio's ability to direct its signal is fundamentally limited by its size. Because radios on IoT and mobile devices must be small and inexpensive, they do not benefit from beamforming.</p>

                        <p>To address this problem, we introduce <em>RFocus</em>, which moves beamforming functions from the radio endpoints to the environment. RFocus includes a two-dimensional surface with a rectangular array of simple RF switch elements. Each switch element either lets the signal through or reflects it. The surface does not emit any power of its own. The state of the elements is set by a software controller to maximize the signal strength at a receiver, with a novel optimization algorithm that uses signal strength measurements from the receiver. The RFocus surface can be manufactured as an inexpensive thin "wallpaper", requiring no wiring. Our prototype implementation improves the median signal strength by 9.5&times;, and the median channel capacity by 2.0&times; inside an office building.</p>

                        <p>  For fear of retribution, the victim of a crime may be willing to report it only if other victims of the same perpetrator also step forward. Common examples include 1) identifying oneself as the victim of sexual harassment, especially by a person in a position of authority or 2) accusing an influential politician, an authoritarian government or ones own employer of corruption. To handle such situations, legal literature has proposed the concept of an <em>allegation escrow</em>: a neutral third-party that collects allegations anonymously, matches them against each other, and de-anonymizes allegers only after de-anonymity thresholds (in terms of number of co-allegers), pre-specified by the allegers, are reached.</p>

                        <p>An allegation escrow can be realized as a single trusted third party; however, this party must be trusted to keep the identity of the alleger and content of the allegation private. To address this problem, this paper introduces Secure Allegation Escrows (SAE, pronounced "say"). A SAE is a group of parties with independent interests and motives, acting <em>jointly</em> as an escrow for collecting allegations from individuals, matching the allegations, and de-anonymizing the allegations when designated thresholds are reached. By design, SAEs provide a very strong property: No less than a majority of parties constituting a SAE can de-anonymize or disclose the content of an allegation without a sufficient number of matching allegations (even in collusion with any number of other allegers). Once a sufficient number of matching allegations exist, all parties can simultaneously disclose the allegation with a verifiable proof of the allegers' identities.  We describe how SAEs can be constructed using a novel authentication protocol and a novel allegation matching and bucketing algorithm, provide formal proofs of the security of our constructions, and provide an evaluation of a prototype implementation, demonstrating feasibility in practice.</p>

                        <p>Network performance monitoring today is restricted by existing
                            switch support for measurement, forcing operators to rely heavily on
                            endpoints with poor visibility into the network core. Switch vendors
                            have added progressively more monitoring features to switches, but
                            the current trajectory of adding specific features is unsustainable
                            given the ever-changing demands of network operators. Instead,
                            we ask what switch hardware primitives are required to support an
                            expressive language of network performance questions. We believe
                            that  the  resulting  switch  hardware  design  could  address  a  wide
                            variety of current and future performance monitoring needs.</p>
                            <p>We present a performance query language, Marple, modeled on familiar functional constructs like map, filter, groupby, and zip. Marple
                            is  backed  by  a  new  programmable  key-value  store  primitive  on
                            switch hardware. The key-value store performs flexible aggregations
                            at line rate (e.g., a moving average of queueing latencies per flow),
                            and scales to millions of keys. We present a Marple compiler that
                            targets a P4-programmable software switch and a simulator for high-
                            speed programmable switches. Marple can express switch queries
                            that could previously run only on end hosts, while Marple queries
                            only occupy a modest fraction of a switch’s hardware resources.</p>
